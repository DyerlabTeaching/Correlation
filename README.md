# Correaltions


## Impetus

Measures of correlation allow you to tell the extent to which two variables systematically change, without assuming any functional relationships.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  
 - Understand the differences between parametric, non-parametric, and randomization methods for hypothesis testing. 
 - Test the normality of data using the Shapiro-Wilks test.
 - Perform basic transformations on data to attempt to get your data more representative of normal data sets.
 - Use the `cor.test()` function for parametric and non-parametric data.
